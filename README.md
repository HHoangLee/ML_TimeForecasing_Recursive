# Time Series CO2 Prediction
This project trains a **Linear Regression** model to predict future CO2 concentrations based on historical values.

## Installation
Install all required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage:
Run the training and prediction script:
python train_model.py

## The script will:
Train a linear regression model on 80% of the data
Evaluate performance on the remaining 20%
Print MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
Predict the next 10 CO2 values based on an initial input window
